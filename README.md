This is my Final POE code with:

  	- Part 1: Register user and log user in
	- Part 2: Create program for task adding with no storage
 	- Part 3: Add storage, searching and deleting tasks

There are no unit tests, they broke my code and I couldn't get it working nicely. 
Including broken tests will cause the code to not run.
I reverted my code to pretest versions so that it runs correctly.
